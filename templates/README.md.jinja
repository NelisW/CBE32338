# CBE 32338 Process Control Laboratory

This repository comprises a collection of Jupyter/Python notebooks supporting the hands on learning of process
control in the laboratory sessions associated with **CBE 32338 Chemical Process Control** taught at the University
of Notre Dame.

The links below display the notebooks as HTML web pages. You can download these notebooks to run on your own laptop. 
To run on your own laptop you will need to install Jupyter and Python 3, such as the
[Anaconda distribution from Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Please let me know (jeff at nd.edu) if you any thoughts or suggestions on how these notebooks could be improved for
teaching and learning the principles of Chemical Process Control.
