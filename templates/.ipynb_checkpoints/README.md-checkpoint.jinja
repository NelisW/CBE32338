# CBE 32338 Process Control Laboratory

This repository comprises a collection of Jupyter/Python notebooks in support of **CBE 30338 Chemical Process Control**
taught at the University of Notre Dame.

The links below display the notebooks as regular HTML web pages. From there you can run the notebook on
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) or download to run on your own laptop. To run on your own
laptop you will need to install Jupyter and Python 3, such as the excellent
[Anaconda distribution from Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Please let me know (jeff at nd.edu) if you any thoughts or suggestions on how these notebooks could be improved for
teaching and learning the principles of Chemical Process Control.
