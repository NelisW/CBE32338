    "# Introduction to Python - A Python Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "by Jacob Gerace. The latest version of this notebook is available at [https://github.com/jckantor/CBE30338](https://github.com/jckantor/CBE30338).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean syntax\n",
    "2. The same code can run on all Operating Systems\n",
    "3. **Extensive first and third party libraries (of particular note for our purposes is NumPy)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Sidenote\n",
    " * This text is written in a Markdown block. Markdown is straightforward way to format writeups in Jupyter, but I won't cover it here for the sake of brevity. \n",
    " * See if you can use Markdown in your next homework, here's a link that explains the formatting: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax . \n",
    " * You can also look at existing Markdown examples (i.e. this worksheet) and emulate the style. Double click a Markdown box in Jupyter to show the code.\n",
    " \n",
    "### LaTeX Sidenote\n",
    "* LaTeX (pronounced \"La-tech\") is a language itself used widely to write documents with symbolic math\n",
    "* When you add a mathematical formula to these markdown blocks, the math is in LaTeX.\n",
    "* Ex from class: $$V \\frac{dC}{dt} = u(t) - Q C(t)$$ \n",
    "* A good resource: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### What I hope you'll get out of this tutorial:\n",
    "* The feeling that you'll \"know where to start\" when you see python code in lecture, or when you need to write python for an assignment.\n",
    "* (You won't be a python expert after one hour)\n",
    "* Basics to variables, lists, conditionals, functions, loops, and the numpy package.\n",
    "* Resources to look further"
