    "All of the problems for this week's assignment have been consolidated into this notebook.  The purpose of this was to make it is easier to submit and grade assignments by keeping all of the parts in one place (this notebook) and available through one interface (Vocareum).  For questions that require no Python programming, simply type your results into a markdown cell. "
